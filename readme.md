# Example 

The following links are displayed differently in the preview: 

- [[inbox]] - Wikilink with ref includes the outer square brackets in the preview.
- [[inbox|aliased inbox]] - Wikilink with ref and alias does not include the outer square brackets in the preview.

Also note that if you remove the link references, both links are displayed without brackets in the preview.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox.md "Inbox"
[inbox|aliased inbox]: inbox.md "Inbox"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
