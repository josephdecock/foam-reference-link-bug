# Example 

The following links are displayed differently in the preview: 

## Includes Square Bracket
- [[inbox]] - Wikilink with ref

## Excludes Square Bracket
- [[inbox|aliased inbox]] - Wikilink with ref and alias
- [[todo]] - Wikilink without ref
- [[todo|aliased todo]] - Wikilink without ref but with alias

Note that I have disabled automatic creation of link references so that I can
show the inconsistent behavior more easily, but these link references are
identical to what would be autogenerated by
`"foam.edit.linkReferenceDefinitions": "withExtensions",`

[inbox|aliased inbox]: inbox.md "Inbox"
[inbox]: inbox.md "Inbox"
